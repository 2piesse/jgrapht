/**
 * A lexicographical breadth-first iterator for an undirected graph.
 * <p>
 * Every vertex has an implicit label (they aren't used explicitly in order to reduce time and
 * memory complexity). When some vertex is returned by this iterator, its index is the number of
 * vertices in this graph minus number of already returned vertices. For a given vertex v its label
 * is a concatenation of indices of already returned vertices, that were also its neighbours, with
 * some separator between them. For example, 7#4#3 is a valid vertex label.
 * <p>
 * Iterator chooses vertex with lexicographically largest label and returns it. It breaks ties
 * arbitrarily. For more information on lexicographical BFS see the following papers: <a
 * href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d4b5/a492f781f23a30773841ec79c46d2ec2eb9c.pdf">

 * href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~naveen/courses/CSL851/uwaterloo.pdf"><i>CS 762: Graph-theoretic
 * algorithms. Lecture notes of a graduate course. University of Waterloo</i></a>.
 * <p>
 * For this iterator to work correctly the graph must not be modified during iteration. Currently
 * there are no means to ensure that, nor to fail-fast. The results of such modifications are
 * undefined.
 *
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type.
