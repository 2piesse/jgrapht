/**
 * Class which represents an abstract extension/encapsulation object.
 * An object, from here on denoted as prototype,can be encapsulated in or extended by another object. An example would be the relation between an edge (prototype) and an annotated edge. The
 * annotated edge encapsulates/extends an edge, thereby augmenting it with additional data. In symbolic form, if b is the prototype class, than a(b) would be its extension. This concept is similar to java's extension where
 * one class is derived from (extends) another class (prototype).
